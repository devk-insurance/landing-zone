# landing-zone

Vendored copy of the AWS LandingZone solution using CloudFormation.

This repository contains the AWS LandingZone solution from version 1.0.2 until 2.4.2

Official release notes of the AWS LandingZone can be found at https://solutions-reference.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-landing-zone/latest/release_notes.html

## repository structure

The repository contains 2 directories, `unzip` and `zip`.

### zip

The `zip` directory contains the zip-files for the respective landing-zone-version. You can use the zip-files directly and unzip them in a place to work on them.

### unzip

The `unzip` directory contains the up-to-date landingzone files extracted from the zip-file of the respective landing-zone-version. Depending on the git-commit of this repositry/git tag, the `unzip` directorie's file-content changes. This way it is possible to track what are the actual file-changes between each landing-zone.

## download zip-files

You can download the zip-files yourself using the `downloadLandingZones.sh` shell-script. The script downloads all resources, including those who had typos.
